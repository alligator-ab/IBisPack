I've coded a set of AFL routines on top of BrokerIBis API. This thin layer protects the user and sometimes makes things simpler by hiding details.
It's highly recommended to use it.
There are 2 files: 

IBis.afl is a wrapper around api, with a few additional useful routines.
IBisOrder.afl is a set of routines to place orders, both basic & complex

As usual docs are in the .afl file
Details will be written there if necessary.
