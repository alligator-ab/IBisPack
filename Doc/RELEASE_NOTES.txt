Introduction of config file 'BrokerIBis.cfg' (BrokerIBisLogPath='...' & more options)
Orders saved/loaded (option SaveOrders=100000 OrdersFilename='...' LoadOrders=1)
News saved/loaded (option SaveNews=50 NewsFilename='...' LoadNews=1)
Optional asynchroous message processing
Full list of options: see sample config file BrokerIBis.cfg
Modified Account, with better listing, more options for GetAccountValue(field, currency, account)

0.9.5:
-----
Bug fixes.
News-related API modified:
	NewsArticle(articleId)										fetch an article
	Headlines(maxHeadLines, symbol = "", providerCode = "")		last headlines, filtered by symbol & providerCode

0.9.4:
-----
Added WhatIf(order, contract, fields). Allows to fetch impact of a (virtual) order such as margin. See 'IBis Test WhatIf.afl' for a sample use.
Modified ParseOrderEx(): takes 2 args now, order and contract strings. 
		ParseOrderEx("action:'BUY',orderType:'MKT',TIF:'GTC',Size:1000", "AAPL-!NASDAQ");
Added RequestFA(faDataType), ReplaceFA(faDataType, strXMLAlloc) for financial advisors profiles/groups/aliases.
Added Headlines(sNewsProviderCode, symbolOrArticleId, maxHeadlines) can be used as follows:
		Headlines("DJNL", "AAPL", 10)	// Last 10 headlines about AAPL from DJNL
		Headlines("", "AAPL", 10)		// All providers
		Headlines("BFRG", "B000Af12")	// returns article from BFRG having id B000Af2 (provider, articleId -> article)
Use limit to get only most recent ones. No limit or limit == 0 means second argument is an articleId, not a symbol

Added Exec("Launch('notepad.exe')") and Exec("System('dir')") exec commands to run external programs.
Added HeadTimestamp(ticker, whatToShow) (first date for historical data) eg HeadTimeStamp("ESH3-CME-FUT", "TRADES") (TRADES/MIDPOINT/BID/ASK/BID_ASK/AGGTRADES...)
Added real-time 5 sec bars streaming:
	reqId = SubscribeRealTimeBars(ticker, barSize = 5, what = "TRADES", rth = false)
	CancelRealTimeBars(reqId) or CancelRealTimeBars(0, ticker)
	bars = RealTimeBars(reqId, ticker, numLastBars)			with either reqId != 0 or ticker not empty
Modified MarketDepth(): order books are automatically cancelled when limit (3) is reached (oldest first).
Added ExecDetails(orderId). Returns the list of partial executions for a specific order (exchange, side, qty, liquidity, price...)
Trying to accomodate UTF8 strings sent by TWS...

0.9.3:
-----
Fixed a few regressions due to API upgrade. Updated scripts.
Changed TickSize argument in PlaceOrder() and ModifyOrder(): when TickSize is < 0 it's the inverse of TickSize e.g:
-128 is equivalent to 10000/128, tick size = 0.0078125
-20000 is equivalent to 0.5 (=10000/20000), tick size = 0.00005
-100 is equivalent to 100, tick size = 0.01

0.9.2:
-----
Changed argument type for Quantity in PlaceOrder() and ModifyOrder(): int -> variant.
As a consequence, it's possible to transmit an integer, a double float or a string (converted to Decimal internally)

0.9.1:
-----
API version changed from 979 to 1019 (Stable)
Decimal introduced
Connection process improved
Second parameter for CancelOrder (= Manual Order Cancel Time, string)

0.9.0:
-----
New minor version, BETA STATUS
Fixed bug with OrderId field in PlaceOrderEx()
Modified GetPositionSize() & GetPositionInfo() (reduce latency)

0.8.9:

Scanner parameters are dumped at start in ScannerParameters.xml

0.8.8:
-----

Added SoftDollarTiers()
Added RunTape()
Fixed Crash at start

0.8.6:
-----
Added HistoricalData() to fetch data from IBKR & save it to a file or send it back into a string to the user (use "" as destFileName)
- endDateTime must be "" if up to now
- if keepUpToDate is True/1, output file is updated at every new bar

Added MatchingSymbols(name_pattern) to get a comma-separated list/string of stocks matching name_pattern e.g "IBM"
Added a few TWS API callbacks (specific to v979+)

0.8.5:
-----
Added new syntax to define/declare contract: eg { conId: ... exchange: ... multiplier: ... } with or without { }
Can be used everywhere a contract is used as input, PlaceOrder() included, not only PlaceOrderEx() & others.

0.8.4:
-----
Added ContractDetails()
FIXED News (at least for Bulletins)
Added filter for News headlines

0.8.3:
-----
FIXED:	regression for complex orders due to wrong update in 0.8.0. Now they're back & tested
Added new fields to PlaceOrderEx:
- nonGuaranteed:	(string/char) '1'/'0' equivalent to SmartComboRoutingParams with 'NonGuaranteed' field added. Much simpler.
- manualOrderTime:	(string)	used by brokers for phone/email orders...

Better diagnostics 

0.8.2:
-----
CHANGED: field symbol in PlaceOrderEx() refers to contract.symbol field (was: symbol <-> ticker)
	Use TICKER field to specify a ticker, NOT symbol
	eg { Ticker: "ESM2-GLOBEX-FUT" ... } instead of { Symbol: "ESM2-GLOBEX-FUT" ... }
	Now Symbol can be used to specify a contract eg
		{ Symbol: "ES", secType: "FUT", primaryExchange: "GLOBEX", currency: "USD", expiry: "202206" ... }


Added new fields to PlaceOrderEx:
- contractID:	(long) unique contract identifier (IB specific, not ISIN) allows to specify a contract with this int instead of TICKER/SYMBOL
- ticker:		(string) better name for SYMBOL (which means underlying symbol in IB API parlance)
- multiplier:	(string) instrument multiplier, necessary because IB sometimes uses the same ticker for different multiplier (!)...
- secIdType:	(string) type of secId, eg "ISIN", "CUSIP", "SEDOL", "RIC"
- secId:		(string) security unique identifier in secIdType scheme
- secType, expiry, currency, strike, right (PUT,CALL), tradingClass, localSymbol, primaryExch/primaryExchange fields to define contracts


Modified:
- exchange:		now takes priority over specified symbol/ticker.


0.8.1:
-----
Added new field to PlaceOrderEx:
- exchange:		(string) specify destination/route. Also useful for algos (CSFB...).


0.8.0:
-----
{ ... } delimiters are unnecessary in PlaceOrderEx() argument.
