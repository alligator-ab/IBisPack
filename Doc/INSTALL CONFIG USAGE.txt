INSTALL
=====

1. Copy BrokerIBis.exe and BrokerIBis.reg and biddll.dll  in Amibroker main directory

2. Register BrokerIBis in Windows register: right-click BrokerIBIs.reg and choose Merge - only once at first install

3. Create a directory IBis into AmiBroker Formulas directory and copy Scripts files into.

4. Insert IBis formulas to see how IBis API calls should be used. Read formulas to understand which/how arguments are used.

5. Enjoy !


INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AB+IBIS:
=======================

1. Start IBKR TWS or Gateway

2. Once TWS is up & running, run BrokerIBis

3. Start AmiBroker. Use it as usual.

NOTE: If BrokerIBis can't start (no window up, no process) the most probable problem is due to the lack of a MS library:
	Microsoft Visual C++ runtime libraries vcredist_x64.exe for Visual Studio 2022
Read:		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170
Download:  	https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe 

Read, download, install, and RESTART your PC. It should work.


USAGE:
=====
To avoid confusion with BrokerIB, it's recommended to always use the following in your script:

	ibis = GetTradingInterface("IBis");
	if (ibis && ibis.IsConnected()) {
		// ...
	} else {
		_TRACE("Unable to Connect to IBis");
	}

All available functions/procedures are listed in API.txt
Read carefully provided scripts for recommended use.

ALTERNATIVE: Create a script .afl (or import existing IBis.afl) to initialize ibis and a define necessary functions hiding calls to TWS API.
See IBis.afl for an example.

NOTES:
=====
biddll.dll is Intel Binary Decimal library and is required for recent API clients.
