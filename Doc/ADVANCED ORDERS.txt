ADVANCED ORDERS
==============

1. SPREADS:
--------------
To specify Spread Contracts in PlaceOrderEx(), use the comboLegs field.
For instance, to specify the first example (Stocks Spread) in TWS API doc

"comboLegs:[ { conId:43645865, action:BUY, ratio:1, exchange:SMART } , { conId:9408, action:SELL, ratio:1, exchange:SMART } ], symbol:MCD, secType:BAG, currency:USD, exchange:SMART"

Each leg is specified as an object in the list (array) of legs.

It's possible to use the helper Spread(ratio1, ticker1, ratio2, ticker2, guaranteed) to create a correct string you can submit to PlaceOrderEx()


2. HEDGES:
-------------
You must place the PARENT order FIRST with TRANSMIT at FALSE.
Then place a second order, the hedge as follows:

"parentId:...., hedgeType:F, quantity:0, ...."

You must specify the parent Id, hedge type, and for FX hedges quantity must be set to 0. 
Do not forget to specify the contract (FX here) at the same time !

It's possible to use the helper Hedge(parentId, parentActio, hedgeTicker, hedgeType, hedgeParam) to create a correct string you can submit to PlaceOrderEx()


3. BRACKETS:
---------------
All components must be placed with the Transmit flag set to false, except for the last one.
You can set its Transmit flag to true or use the Transmit(orderId) call to set it after placing it.
The first order is used as parent: set the parentId field of the othe legs to its parentId.
The stop and the target must have an action opposite to the main leg (BUY <-> SELL).
Of course you must specify the same contract for the 3 legs. 

Example: 

You specify the contract:
contract = ",....,"

First order:
	"action:BUY, totalQuantity:100, orderType:LMT, lmtPrice:35.20, transmit:false,"+ contract

You get its parentId as immediate answer.

Second order (target):
	"action:SELL, totalQuantity:100, orderType:LMT, lmtPrice: 36.0, transmit:false, parentId:" + parentId + "," + contract 

Third order (stop):
	"action:SELL, totalQuantity:100, orderType:STP, lmtPrice: 35.0, transmit:true, parentId:" + parentId + "," + contract 


EXPERIMENTAL ONLY !
Since v0.9.7 It's possible to place a bracket order as a batch order using 
	PlaceBracketOrder(action, size, ticker, price, stopPrice, targetPrice, delay)


4. OCA:
--------
OCA can be used to place exclusive orders, where only one of them in the group will be executed.
It can be used to achieve alternative goals or even place brackets.
A classic bracket can be replaced by a main order and an oca group composed of a stop and a target orders.
