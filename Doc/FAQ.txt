GENERAL
=======
1. When I try to call BrokerIBis from another software (through COM API) I get a null handle.
	You must register BrokerIBis.exe before using it. Run BrokerIBis.reg (right-click).

PLACEORDEREX():
============
1. What is priority between fields ?
	Some fields 'overlap'. In that case, fields at the right take priority. However there's 1 exception: exchange.
	This field should not be modified by Ticker for instance. 
	Fields can be specified several times, only the latest/rightest matters. 

2. Where is the doc for PlaceOrderEx ?
	PlaceOrderEx() originally supported a JSON syntax. It's been relaxed in following versions.
	Now "orderType=MKT action=BUY size=100 ticker=IBM" should work.
	At the moment new fields are added to PlaceOrderEx (Backward compatible).
	Almost 300 fields are available. Every field in Order Class and some in contract class.
	Read RELEASE NOTES & JsonIndex.h.

3. How to identify an instrument with PlaceOrderEx() ?
	First it supports PlaceOrder() ticker field. So any IBKR ticker should work.
	Second it also supports IB unique contract identifer (a long) which can be retrieved from TWS (right click instrument)
	It also supports ISIN & other schemes using secID & secIDType fields.
	Finally it's possible to disambiguify a ticker by specifying a multiplier ('multiplier' field)

4. Are PlaceOrderEx() fields case-sensitive ?
	Yes & No. subfields (in objects/arrays) are case-sensitive, but not fields at root level.

5. How to specify traded contract ?
	Depends on trade type. For outright trades, use
	either	Ticker: 'ESM2-GLOBEX-FUT' ...
	or		Symbol: 'ES', expiry: '202206', secType: 'FUT', primaryExchange: 'GLOBEX', currency: 'USD'
	both are equivalent. 
	It's better to use primaryExchange to specify a contract and Exchange to specify destination (or route, eg SMART)

6. How to use IB algos ?
	Here are a few samples:
	Adaptive:
		algoStrategy: 'Adaptive', algoParams: { adaptivePriority: 'Normal' }, 
			Ticker:'ZF   JUN 22-ECBOT-FUT', Size:1, TIF: 'DAY', Type : 'LMT', Action: 'BUY', LimitPrice: 113.5078125, Transmit: False

	Midprice:
		Action: 'BUY', Ticker:'IBM', Size:100, TIF: 'DAY', Type: 'MIDPRICE', Transmit:False

	VWAP:
		algoStrategy: 'Vwap', algoParams: { maxPctVol: '0.1', startTime: '09:45:30 EST', endTime: '15:15:30 EST', allowPastEndTime: '0', noTakeLiq:'1',
		Transmit: False, Action: 'BUY', Ticker:'ZF   JUN 22-ECBOT-FUT', Size:50, TIF: 'DAY', Type: 'LMT', LimitPrice: 113

7. How to trade spreads ?
	(read also https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/spread_contracts.html 
			and https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/classIBApi_1_1ComboLeg.html !)
	Here is equivalent for last sample:

	symbol: 'CL.BZ', secType: 'BAG', currency: 'USD', exchange: 'NYMEX',
	comboLegs: [ { conId: 47207310, action: 'BUY', ratio: 1, exchange: 'NYMEX' },
				 { conId: 47195961, action: 'SELL', ratio: 1, exchange: 'NYMEX' } ]

	Or: 

	symbol: 'CL.BZ', secType: 'BAG', currency: 'USD', exchange: 'NYMEX',
	comboLegs: [ { conId: 47207310, ratio: 1 },
				 { conId: 47195961, ratio: -1 } ]

	When not specified, exchange is the one specified BEFORE for the contract and action depends on ratio sign.

8. How to specify prices for each leg in a combo limit order ?
	(read https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/basic_orders.html#limitordercombolegprices )
	Provides each leg prices in an array (delimited by [ and  ]) and eventually specify if it's guaranteed eg

		orderType:'LMT', orderComboLegs:[ 123.0, 35.5 ], nonGuaranteed: '1'
