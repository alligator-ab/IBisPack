# IBisPack

**IBisPack** is a collection of AFL scripts and tools designed to use **IBis** (BrokerIBis.exe) with [AmiBroker](https://www.amibroker.com/). IBis is a relay between TWS (Interactive Brokers desktop trading software) and users' trading software. IBis provides an easy way to access [Interactive Brokers TWS API](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/#api-introduction) through a **COM** API. It's intended to replace [IBController](https://gitlab.com/amibroker/ibcontroller) and extend its API to use all of TWS API (up to v1030 included).
